  <TheAnomaly.description>Your research expedition has finally arrived at the source of the anomalous signal: an ancient archotech monolith on a distant planet. As you survey the structure from orbit, the scanner's audio feed forms garbled syllables which repeat your own name over and over. Your crewmate screams as her flesh begins flowing and reforming. A blinding beam of energy reaches up from the planet and tears your research vessel apart. You have disturbed something ancient and inhuman.\n\nNote: This is a difficult scenario and is not recommended for new players.</TheAnomaly.description>
