  <Mechanitor.description>You knew you could only achieve greatness with help. People were too unreliable, so you chose to take on mechanoids as your servants, workers, and warriors. As you gained strength, others became fearful. It became clear you needed to get away from the influence of humanity. Now you've migrated to this sparsely-populated rimworld with some of your metallic helpers. Finally, you have the space to grasp your true potential!\n\nNote: Since your starting character will lack some skills, this is a difficult scenario.</Mechanitor.description>

Stowing away on the first starship leaving the system, you barely escaped alive.\n\nNote: Sanguophages have unique strengths and weaknesses, which makes this a difficult scenario.</Sanguophage.description>
